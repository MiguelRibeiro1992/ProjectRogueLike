Project RogueLike - 2D Dungeoncrawler game

This was my first ever project;
1 month after applying for a 6 months intensive JAVA Course from Upskill program;
Not perfect but fully playable until the end :)

Some changes I would make after working on this project (now more experienced):
- Organize and optimize my code better (spreading respective code across multiple classes/interfaces);
- Implement superclasses and abstract classes better;
- Correct some bugs/sound bugs;
- Implement more interfaces.
